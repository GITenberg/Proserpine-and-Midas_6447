<h3>PREFATORY NOTE.</h3>

<p class="prose">The editor came across the unpublished texts
included in this volume as early as 1905. Perhaps he ought to
apologize for delaying their appearance in print. The fact is he
has long been afraid of overrating their intrinsic value. But as
the great Shelley centenary year has come, perhaps this little
monument of his wife&rsquo;s collaboration may take its modest place
among the tributes which will be paid to his memory. For Mary
Shelley&rsquo;s mythological dramas can at least claim to be the proper
setting for some of the most beautiful lyrics of the poet, which so
far have been read in undue isolation. And even as a literary sign
of those times, as an example of that classical renaissance which
the romantic period fostered, they may not be altogether
negligible.</p>

<p class="prose">These biographical and literary points have been
dealt with in an introduction for which the kindest help was long
ago received from the late Dr. Garnett and the late Lord Abinger.
Sir Walter Raleigh was also among the first to give both
encouragement and guidance. My friends M. Emile Pons and Mr. Roger
Ingpen have read the book in manuscript. The authorities of the
Bodleian Library and of the Clarendon Press have been as generously
helpful as is their well-known wont. To all the editor wishes to
record his acknowledgements and thanks.</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>

<h4>I.</h4>

<p class="prose">&lsquo;The compositions published in Mrs. Shelley&rsquo;s
lifetime afford but an inadequate conception of the intense
sensibility and mental vigour of this extraordinary woman.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="prose">Thus wrote Dr. Garnett, in 1862 (Preface to his
<span class="booktitle">Relics of Shelley</span>). The words of
praise may have sounded unexpectedly warm at that date. Perhaps the
present volume will make the reader more willing to subscribe, or
less inclined to demur.</p>

<p class="prose">Mary Godwin in her younger days certainly
possessed a fair share of that nimbleness of invention which
generally characterizes women of letters. <a name="ref101">Her
favourite pastime as a child, she herself testifies,</a><a href=
"#fn101" class="fnref">1</a> had been to write stories. And a
dearer pleasure had been&mdash;to use her own characteristic abstract and
elongated way of putting it&mdash;&lsquo;the following up trains of thought
which had for their subject the formation of a succession of
imaginary incidents&rsquo;. All readers of Shelley&rsquo;s life remember how
later on, as a girl of nineteen&mdash;and a two years&rsquo; wife&mdash;she was
present, &lsquo;a devout but nearly silent listener&rsquo;, at the long
symposia held by her husband and Byron in Switzerland (June 1816),
and how the pondering over &lsquo;German horrors&rsquo;, and a common resolve
to perpetrate ghost stories of their own, led her to imagine that
most unwomanly of all feminine romances, <span class=
"booktitle">Frankenstein</span>. The paradoxical effort was
paradoxically successful, and, as publishers&rsquo; lists aver to this
day, Frankenstein&rsquo;s monster has turned out to be the hardest-lived
specimen of the &lsquo;raw-head-and-bloody-bones&rsquo; school of romantic
tales. So much, no doubt, to the credit of Mary Shelley. But more
creditable, surely, is the fact that she was not tempted, as &lsquo;Monk&rsquo;
Lewis had been, to persevere in those lugubrious themes.</p>

<p class="prose">Although her publishers&mdash;<span class="foreign">et
pour cause</span>&mdash;insisted on styling her &lsquo;the author of
Frankenstein&rsquo;, an entirely different vein appears in her later
productions. Indeed, a quiet reserve of tone, a slow, sober, and
sedate bearing, are henceforth characteristic of all her literary
attitudes. It is almost a case of running from one to the other
extreme. The force of style which even adverse critics acknowledged
in <span class="booktitle">Frankenstein</span> was sometimes
perilously akin to the most disputable kinds of romantic rant. But
in the historical or society novels which followed, in the
contributions which graced the &lsquo;Keepsakes&rsquo; of the thirties, and
even&mdash;alas&mdash;in the various prefaces and commentaries which
accompanied the publication of so many poems of Shelley, his wife
succumbed to an increasing habit of almost Victorian reticence and
dignity. And those later novels and tales, though they sold well in
their days and were kindly reviewed, can hardly boast of any
reputation now. Most of them are pervaded by a brooding spirit of
melancholy of the &lsquo;moping&rsquo; rather than the &lsquo;musical&rsquo; sort, and
consequently rather ineffective as an artistic motive. Students of
Shelley occasionally scan those pages with a view to pick some
obscure &lsquo;hints and indirections&rsquo;, some veiled reminiscences, in the
stories of the adventures and misfortunes of <span class=
"booktitle">The Last Man</span> or <span class=
"booktitle">Lodore</span>. And the books may be good biography at
times&mdash;they are never life.</p>

<p class="prose">Altogether there is a curious contrast between the
two aspects, hitherto revealed, of Mary Shelley&rsquo;s literary
activities. It is as if the pulse which had been beating so wildly,
so frantically, in <span class="booktitle">Frankenstein</span>
(1818), had lapsed, with <span class="booktitle">Valperga</span>
(1823) and the rest, into an increasingly sluggish flow.</p>

<p class="prose">The following pages may be held to bridge the gap
between those two extremes in a felicitous way. A more purely
artistic mood, instinct with the serene joy and clear warmth of
Italian skies, combining a good deal of youthful buoyancy with a
sort of quiet and unpretending philosophy, is here represented. And
it is submitted that the little classical fancies which Mrs.
Shelley never ventured to publish are quite as worthy of
consideration as her more ambitious prose works.</p>

<p class="prose">For one thing they give us the longest poetical
effort of the writer. The moon of <span class=
"booktitle">Epipsychidion</span> never seems to have been thrilled
with the music of the highest spheres. Yet there were times when
Shelley&rsquo;s inspiration and example fired her into something more
than her usual calm and cold brilliancy.</p>

<p class="prose">One of those periods&mdash;perhaps the happiest period
in Mary&rsquo;s life&mdash;was during the early months in Italy of the English
&lsquo;exiles&rsquo;. <a name="ref102">&lsquo;She never was more strongly impelled to
write than at this time; she felt her powers fresh and strong
within her; all she wanted was some motive, some suggestion to
guide her in the choice of a subject.&rsquo;</a><a href="#fn102" class=
"fnref">2</a></p>

<p class="prose">Shelley then expected her to try her hand at a
drama, perhaps on the terrible story of the Cenci, or again on the
catastrophes of Charles the First. Her <span class=
"booktitle">Frankenstein</span> was attracting more attention than
had ever been granted to his own works. And Shelley, with that
touching simplicity which characterized his loving moments, showed
the greatest confidence in the literary career of his wife. He
helped her and encouraged her in every way. He then translated for
her Plato&rsquo;s <span class="booktitle">Symposium</span>. He led her on
in her Latin and Italian studies. He wanted her&mdash;probably as a sort
of preliminary exercise before her flight into tragedy&mdash;to translate
Alfieri&rsquo;s <span class="booktitle">Myrrha</span>. &lsquo;Remember <span
class="booktitle">Charles the First</span>, and do you be prepared
to bring at least some of <span class="booktitle">Myrrha</span>
translated,&rsquo; he wrote; &lsquo;remember, remember <span class=
"booktitle">Charles the First</span> and <span class=
"booktitle">Myrrha</span>,&rsquo; he insisted; and he quoted, for her
benefit, the presumptuous aphorism of Godwin, in <span class=
"booktitle">St. Leon</span>, <a name="ref103">&lsquo;There is nothing
which the human mind can conceive which it may not execute&rsquo;.</a><a
href="#fn103" class="fnref">3</a></p>

<p class="prose">But in the year that followed these auspicious
days, the strain and stress of her life proved more powerful on
Mary Shelley than the inspiration of literature. The loss of her
little girl Clara, at Venice, on the 24th of September 1818, was
cruel enough. However, she tried hard not to show the
&lsquo;pusillanimous disposition&rsquo; which, Godwin assured his daughter,
characterizes the persons <a name="ref104">&lsquo;that sink long under a
calamity of this nature&rsquo;.</a><a href="#fn104" class="fnref">4</a>
But the death of her boy, William, at Rome, on the 4th of June
1819, reduced her to a &lsquo;kind of despair&rsquo;. Whatever it could be to
her husband, Italy no longer was for her a &lsquo;paradise of exiles&rsquo;.
The flush and excitement of the early months, the &lsquo;first fine
careless rapture&rsquo;, were for ever gone. &lsquo;I shall never recover that
blow,&rsquo; Mary wrote on the 27th of June 1819; &lsquo;the thought never
leaves me for a single moment; everything on earth has lost its
interest for me,&rsquo; This time her imperturbable father
&rsquo;philosophized&rsquo; in vain. With a more sympathetic and acuter
intelligence of her case, Leigh Hunt insisted (July 1819) that she
should try and give her paralysing sorrow some literary expression,
&lsquo;strike her pen into some... genial subject... and bring up a
fountain of gentle tears for us&rsquo;. But the poor childless mother
could only rehearse her complaint&mdash;&lsquo;to have won, and thus cruelly to
have lost&rsquo; (4 August 1819). In fact she had, on William&rsquo;s death,
discontinued her diary.</p>

<p class="prose">Yet on the date just mentioned, as Shelley reached
his twenty-seven years, she plucked up courage and resumed the
task. Shelley, however absorbed by the creative ardour of his <span
class="foreign">Annus mirabilis</span>, could not but observe that
his wife&rsquo;s &lsquo;spirits continued wretchedly depressed&rsquo; (5 August
1819); and though masculine enough to resent the fact at times more
than pity it, he was human enough to persevere in that habit of
co-operative reading and writing which is one of the finest traits
of his married life. <a name="ref105">&lsquo;I write in the morning,&rsquo; his
wife testifies, &lsquo;read Latin till 2, when we dine; then I read some
English book, and two cantos of Dante with Shelley&rsquo;</a><a href=
"#fn105" class="fnref">5</a> &mdash;a fair average, no doubt, of the
homely aspect of the great days which produced <span class=
"booktitle">The Cenci</span> and <span class=
"booktitle">Prometheus</span>.</p>

<p class="prose">On the 12th November, in Florence, the birth of a
second son, Percy Florence Shelley, helped Mary out of her sense of
bereavement. Subsequent letters still occasionally admit &lsquo;low
spirits&rsquo;. But the entries in the Journal make it clear that the
year 1819-20 was one of the most pleasantly industrious of her
life. Not Dante only, but a motley series of books, great and
small, ancient and modern, English and foreign, bespoke her
attention. Not content with Latin, and the extemporized
translations which Shelley could give her of Plato&rsquo;s <span class=
"booktitle">Republic</span>, she started Greek in 1820, and soon
came to delight in it. And again she thought of original
composition. &lsquo;Write&rsquo;, &lsquo;work,&rsquo;&mdash;the words now occur daily in her
Journal. <a name="ref106">These must mainly refer to the long
historical novel, which she had planned, as early as 1819,</a><a
href="#fn106" class="fnref">6</a> under the title of <span class=
"booktitle">Castruccio</span>, <span class="booktitle">Prince of
Lucca</span>, and which was not published until 1823, as <span
class="booktitle">Valperga</span>. It was indeed a laborious task.
<a name="ref107">The novel &lsquo;illustrative of the manners of the
Middle Ages in Italy&rsquo; had to be &lsquo;raked out of fifty old books&rsquo;, as
Shelley said.</a> <a href="#fn107" class="fnref">7</a></p>

<p class="prose">But heavy as the undertaking must have been, it
certainly did not engross all the activities of Shelley&rsquo;s wife in
this period. And it seems highly probable that the two little
mythological dramas which we here publish belong to this same year
1820.</p>

<p class="prose">The evidence for this date is as follows.
Shelley&rsquo;s lyrics, which these dramas include, were published by his
wife (<span class="booktitle">Posthumous Poems</span>, 1824) among
the &lsquo;poems written in 1820&rsquo;. <a name="ref108">Another composition,
in blank verse, curiously similar to Mary&rsquo;s own work, entitled
<span class="booktitle">Orpheus</span>, has been allotted by Dr.
Garnett (<span class="booktitle">Relics of Shelley</span>, 1862) to
the same category.</a> <a href="#fn108" class="fnref">8</a> Again,
it may well be more than a coincidence, that the Proserpine motive
occurs in that passage from Dante&rsquo;s <span class=
"booktitle">Purgatorio</span>, canto 28, on &lsquo;Matilda gathering
flowers&rsquo;, which Shelley is known to have translated shortly before
Medwin&rsquo;s visit in the late autumn of 1820.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="script"><a name=
"ref109">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O come,
that I may hear<br>
 Thy song: like Proserpine, in Enna&rsquo;s glen,<br>
 Thou seemest to my fancy,&mdash;singing here,<br>
 And gathering flowers, as that fair maiden, when<br>
 She lost the spring and Ceres her more dear.</a><a href="#fn109"
class="fnref">9</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="prose"><a name="ref110">But we have a far more important,
because a direct, testimony in a manuscript addition made by Thomas
Medwin in the margin of a copy of his <span class="booktitle">Life
of Shelley</span> (1847).</a> <a href="#fn110" class="fnref">10</a>
The passage is clearly intended&mdash;though chronology is no more than
any other exact science the &lsquo;forte&rsquo; of that most tantalizing of
biographers&mdash;to refer to the year 1820.</p>

<p class="prose">&lsquo;Mrs. Shelley had at this time been writing some
little Dramas on classical subjects, one of which was the Rape of
Proserpine, a very graceful composition which she has never
published. Shelley contributed to this the exquisite fable of
Arethusa and the Invocation to Ceres.&mdash;Among the Nymphs gathering
flowers on Enna were two whom she called Ino and Uno, names which I
remember in the Dialogue were irresistibly ludicrous. She also
wrote one on Midas, into which were introduced by Shelley, in the
Contest between Pan and Apollo, the Sublime Effusion of the latter,
and Pan&rsquo;s characterised Ode.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="prose"><a name="ref111">This statement of Medwin finally
settles the question. The &lsquo;friend&rsquo; at whose request, Mrs. Shelley
says,</a> <a href="#fn111" class="fnref">11</a> the lyrics were
written by her husband, was herself. <a name="ref112">And she was
the author of the dramas.</a><a href="#fn112" class=
"fnref">12</a></p>

<p class="prose">The manuscript (Bodleian Library, MS. Shelley, d.
2) looks like a cheap exercise-book, originally of 40, now of 36
leaves, 8 1/4 x 6 inches, in boards. <a name="ref113">The contents
are the dramas here presented, written in a clear legible hand&mdash;the
equable hand of Mrs. Shelley.</a> <a href="#fn113" class=
"fnref">13</a> There are very few words corrected or cancelled. It
is obviously a fair copy. Mr. C. D. Locock, in his <span class=
"booktitle">Examination of the Shelley Manuscripts in the Bodleian
Library</span> (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1903, pp. 24-25), has
already pointed out the valuable emendations of the &lsquo;received&rsquo; text
of Shelley&rsquo;s lyrics which are found here. In fact the only mystery
is why neither Shelley, nor Mary in the course of her long widowed
years, should have published these curious, and surely not
contemptible, by-products of their co-operation in the fruitful
year 1820.</p>

her toils as amanuensis <span class="foreign">Aspetto fin che il

parole</span>&rsquo;. The poem is thus supposed to have been Shelley&rsquo;s
attempt at improvisation, if not indeed a translation from the
Italian of the &lsquo;improvvisatore&rsquo; Sgricci. The Shelleys do not seem
to have come to know and hear Sgricci before the end of December
1820. The Italian note after all has no very clear import. And Dr.
Garnett in 1905 inclined to the view that <span class=
"booktitle">Orpheus</span> was the work not of Shelley, but of his
wife. A comparison of that fragment and the dramas here published
seems to me to suggest the same conclusion, though in both cases
Mary Shelley must have been helped by her husband.</a><br>

</p>

<hr>
<h4>II.</h4>

<p class="prose">For indeed there is more than a personal interest
attached to these writings of Mrs. Shelley&rsquo;s. The fact that the
same mind which had revelled, a few years earlier, in the
fantastical horrors of Frankenstein&rsquo;s abortive creation, could now
dwell on the melancholy fate of Proserpine or the humorous
disappointment of Midas, and delight in their subtle poetical or
moral symbolism&mdash;this fact has its significance. It is one of the
earliest indications of the revival, in the heart of Romanticism,
of the old love of classical myths and classical beauty.</p>

<p class="prose">The subject is a wide one, and cannot be
adequately dealt with in this place. But a few words may not be
superfluous for a correct historical appreciation of Mrs. Shelley&rsquo;s
attempt.</p>

<p class="prose">How deficient had been the sense of classical
beauty in the so-called classical age of English literature, is a
trite consideration of criticism. The treatment of mythology is
particularly conclusive on this point. Throughout the &lsquo;Augustan&rsquo;
era, mythology was approached as a mere treasure-house of pleasant
fancies, artificial decorations, &lsquo;motives&rsquo;, whether sumptuous or
meretricious. Allusions to Jove and Venus, Mercury, Apollo, or
Bacchus, are of course found in every other page of Dryden, Pope,
Prior, Swift, Gay, and Parnell. But no fresh presentation, no
loving interpretation, of the old myths occur anywhere. The
immortal stories were then part and parcel of a sort of poetical
curriculum through which the whole school must be taken by the
stern masters Tradition and Propriety. There is little to be
wondered at, if this matter of curriculum was treated by the more
passive scholars as a matter of course, and by the sharper and less
reverent disciples as a matter of fun. Indeed, if any personality
is then evinced in the adaptation of these old world themes, it is
generally connected with a more or less emphatic disparagement or
grotesque distortion of their real meaning.</p>

<p class="prose">When Dryden, for example, makes use of the legend
of Midas, in his <span class="booktitle">Wife of Bath&rsquo;s
Tale</span>, he makes, not Midas&rsquo;s minister, but his queen, tell
the mighty secret&mdash;and thus secures another hit at woman&rsquo;s
loquacity.</p>

<p class="prose">Prior&rsquo;s <span class="booktitle">Female
Pha&euml;ton</span> is a younger sister, who, jealous of her elder&rsquo;s
success, thus pleads with her &lsquo;mamma&rsquo;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="script">I&rsquo;ll have my earl as well as she<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;Or know the reason why.<br>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="prosecont">And she wants to flaunt it accordingly.</p>

<p class="prose">Finally,</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="script">Fondness prevailed; mamma gave way;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;Kitty, at heart&rsquo;s desire,<br>
 Obtained the chariot for a day,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;And set the world on fire.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="prose">Pandora, in Parnell&rsquo;s <span class=
"booktitle">Hesiod or the Rise of Woman</span>, is only a</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="script">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;shining
vengeance...<br>
 A pleasing bosom-cheat, a specious ill&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="prosecont">sent by the gods upon earth to punish the race
of Prometheus.</p>

<p class="prose">The most poetical fables of Greece are desecrated
by Gay into mere miniatures for the decoration of his <span class=
"booktitle">Fan</span>.</p>

<p class="prose">Similar instances abound later on. When Armstrong
brings in an apostrophe to the Naiads, it is in the course of a
<span class="booktitle">Poetical Essay on the Art of Preserving
Health</span>. And again, when Cowper stirs himself to intone an
<span class="booktitle">Ode to Apollo</span>, it is in the same
mock-heroic vein:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="script">Patron of all those luckless brains,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;That to the wrong side leaning<br>
 Indite much metre with much pains<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;And little or no meaning...</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="prose">Even in Gray&rsquo;s&mdash;&lsquo;Pindaric Gray&rsquo;s&rsquo;&mdash;treatment of
classical themes, there is a sort of pervading <span class=
"foreign">ennui</span>, or the forced appreciativeness of a gouty,
disappointed man. The daughter of Jove to whom he dedicates his
hymns too often is &lsquo;Adversity&rsquo;. And classical reminiscences have,
even with him, a dull musty tinge which recalls the antiquarian in
his Cambridge college-rooms rather than the visitor to Florence and
Rome. For one thing, his allusions are too many, and too
transitory, to appear anything but artistic tricks and verse-making
tools. The &lsquo;Aegean deep&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Delphi&rsquo;s steep&rsquo;, and
&lsquo;Meander&rsquo;s amber waves&rsquo;, and the &lsquo;rosy-crowned Loves&rsquo;, are too
cursorily summoned, and dismissed, to suggest that they have been
brought in for their own sweet sakes.</p>

<p class="prose">It was thus with all the fine quintessences of
ancient lore, with all the pearl-like accretions of the faiths and
fancies of the old world: they were handled about freely as a kind
of curious but not so very rare coins, which found no currency in
the deeper thoughts of our modern humanity, and could therefore be
used as a mere badge of the learning and taste of a literary
&lsquo;coterie&rsquo;.</p>

<p class="prose">The very names of the ancient gods and heroes were
in fact assuming that abstract anaemic look which common nouns have
in everyday language. Thus, when Garrick, in his verses <span
class="booktitle">Upon a Lady&rsquo;s Embroidery</span>, mentions
&lsquo;Arachne&rsquo;, it is obvious that he does not expect the reader to
think of the daring challenger of Minerva&rsquo;s art, or the Princess of
Lydia, but just of a plain spider. And again, when Falconer, in his
early <span class="booktitle">Monody on the death of the Prince of
Wales</span>, expresses a rhetorical wish</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="script">&lsquo;to aid hoarse howling Boreas with his
sighs,&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="prosecont">that particular son of Astr&aelig;us, whose love for
the nymph Orithyia was long unsuccessful, because he could not
&lsquo;sigh&rsquo;, is surely far from the poet&rsquo;s mind; and &lsquo;to swell the
wind&rsquo;, or &lsquo;the gale&rsquo;, would have served his turn quite as well,
though less &lsquo;elegantly&rsquo;.</p>

<p class="prose">Even Gibbon, with all his partiality for whatever
was pre- or post- Christian, had indeed no better word than
&lsquo;elegant&rsquo; for the ancient mythologies of Greece and Rome, and he
surely reflected no particularly advanced opinion when he praised
and damned, in one breath, <a name="ref201">&lsquo;the pleasant and
absurd system of Paganism.&rsquo;</a><a href="#fn201" class="fnref">1</a>
No wonder if in his days, and for a long time after, the passionate
giants of the Ages of Fable had dwindled down to the pretty puppets
with which the daughters of the gentry had to while away many a
school hour.</p>

<p class="prose">But the days of this rhetorical&mdash;or satirical,
didactic&mdash;or perfunctory, treatment of classical themes were doomed.
It is the glory of Romanticism to have opened &lsquo;magic casements&rsquo; not
only on &lsquo;the foam of perilous seas&rsquo; in the West, but also on</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="script"><a name=
"ref202">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the chambers of the
East,<br>
 The chambers of the Sun, that now<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;From ancient melody had ceased.</a><a href="#fn202"
class="fnref">2</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="prosecont">Romanticism, as a freshening up of all the
sources of life, a general rejuvenescence of the soul, a ubiquitous
visiting of the spirit of delight and wonder, could not confine
itself to the fields of mediaeval romance. Even the records of the
Greek and Roman thought assumed a new beauty; the classical sense
was let free from its antiquarian trammels, and the perennial fanes
resounded to the songs of a more impassioned worship.</p>

<p class="prose">The change, however, took some time. And it must
be admitted that in England, especially, the Romantic movement was
slow to go back to classical themes. Winckelmann and Goethe, and
Ch&eacute;nier&mdash;the last, indeed, practically all unknown to his
contemporaries&mdash;had long rediscovered Antiquity, and felt its pulse
anew, and praised its enduring power, when English poetry had
little, if anything, to show in answer to the plaintive invocation
of Blake to the Ancient Muses.</p>

<p class="prose">The first generation of English Romantics either
shunned the subject altogether, or simply echoed Blake&rsquo;s isolated
lines in isolated passages as regretful and almost as despondent.
From Persia to Paraguay Southey could wander and seek after exotic
themes; his days could be &lsquo;passed among the dead&rsquo;&mdash;but neither the
classic lands nor the classic heroes ever seem to have detained
him. <a name="ref203">Walter Scott&rsquo;s &lsquo;sphere of sensation may be
almost exactly limited by the growth of heather&rsquo;, as Ruskin
says;</a><a href="#fn203" class="fnref">3</a> and when he came to
Rome, his last illness prevented him from any attempt he might have
wished to make to enlarge his field of vision. <a name=
"ref204">Wordsworth was even less far-travelled, and his home-made
poetry never thought of the &lsquo;Pagan&rsquo; and his &lsquo;creed outworn&rsquo;, but as
a distinct <span class="foreign">pis-aller</span> in the way of
inspiration.</a><a href="#fn204" class="fnref">4</a> And again,
though Coleridge has a few magnificent lines about them, he seems
to have even less willingly than Wordsworth hearkened after</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="script"><a name="ref205">The intelligible forms of
ancient poets,<br>
 The fair humanities of old religion.</a><a href="#fn205" class=
"fnref">5</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="prose">It was to be otherwise with the later English
Romantic poets. They lived and worked at a time when the whole
atmosphere and even the paraphernalia of literary composition had
just undergone a considerable change. After a period of comparative
seclusion and self-concentration, England at the Peace of Amiens
once more found its way to Europe&mdash;and vice versa. And from our
point of view this widening of prospects is especially noticeable.
For the classical revival in Romanticism appears to be closely
connected with it.</p>

<p class="prose"><a name="ref206">It is an alluring subject to
investigate. How the progress of scholarship, the recent &lsquo;finds&rsquo; of
archaeology, the extension of travelling along Mediterranean
shores, the political enthusiasms evoked by the stirrings of young
Italy and young Greece, all combined to reawaken in the poetical
imagination of the times the dormant memories of antiquity has not
yet been told by the historians of literature.</a><a href="#fn206"
class="fnref">6</a></p>

<p class="prose">But&mdash;and this is sufficient for our purpose&mdash;every
one knows what the Elgin Marbles have done for Keats and Shelley;
and what inspirations were derived from their pilgrimages in
classic lands by all the poets of this and the following
generation, from Byron to Landor. Such experiences could not but
react on the common conception of mythology. A knowledge of the
great classical sculpture of Greece could not but invest with a new
dignity and chastity the notions which so far had been nurtured on
the Venus de&rsquo; Medici and the Belvedere Apollo&mdash;even Shelley lived
and possibly died under their spell. <a name="ref207">And
&lsquo;returning to the nature which had inspired the ancient myths&rsquo;, the
Romantic poets must have felt with a keener sense &lsquo;their exquisite
vitality&rsquo;.</a><a href="#fn207" class="fnref">7</a> The whole tenor
of English Romanticism may be said to have been affected
thereby.</p>

<p class="prose">For English Romanticism&mdash;and this is one of its
most distinctive merits&mdash;had no exclusiveness about it. It was too
spontaneous, one would almost say, too unconscious, ever to be
clannish. It grew, untrammelled by codes, uncrystallized into
formulas, a living thing always, not a subject-matter for
grandiloquent manifestoes and more or less dignified squabbles. It
could therefore absorb and turn to account elements which seemed
antagonistic to it in the more sophisticated forms it assumed in
other literatures. <a name="ref208">Thus, whilst French
Romanticism&mdash;in spite of what it may or may not have owed to
Ch&eacute;nier&mdash;became often distinctly, deliberately, wilfully
anti-classical, whilst for example</a><a href="#fn208" class=
"fnref">8</a> Victor Hugo in that all-comprehending <span class=
"booktitle">L&eacute;gende des Si&egrave;cles</span> could find room for the
Hegira and for Zim-Zizimi, but did not consecrate a single line to
the departed glories of mythical Greece, the Romantic poets of
England may claim to have restored in freshness and purity the
religion of antiquity. Indeed their voice was so convincing that
even the great Christian chorus that broke out afresh in the
Victorian era could not entirely drown it, and Elizabeth Barrett
had an apologetic way of dismissing &lsquo;the dead Pan&rsquo;, and all the
&lsquo;vain false gods of Hellas&rsquo;, with an acknowledgement of</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="script">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your beauty which
confesses<br>
 Some chief Beauty conquering you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="prose">This may be taken to have been the average
attitude, in the forties, towards classical mythology. That twenty
years before, at least in the Shelley circle, it was far less
grudging, we now have definite proof.</p>

<p class="prose">Not only was Shelley prepared to admit, with the
liberal opinion of the time, that ancient mythology &lsquo;was a system
of nature concealed under the veil of allegory&rsquo;, a system in which
<a name="ref209">&lsquo;a thousand fanciful fables contained a secret and
mystic meaning&rsquo;:</a><a href="#fn209" class="fnref">9</a> he was
prepared to go a considerable step farther, and claim that there
was no essential difference between ancient mythology and the
theology of the Christians, that both were interpretations, in more
or less figurative language, of the great mysteries of being, and
indeed that the earlier interpretation, precisely because it was
more frankly figurative and poetical than the later one, was better
fitted to stimulate and to allay the sense of wonder which ought to
accompany a reverent and high-souled man throughout his
life-career.</p>

<p class="prose">In the earlier phase of Shelley&rsquo;s thought, this
identification of the ancient and the modern faiths was derogatory
to both. The letter which he had written in 1812 for ihe
edification of Lord Ellenborough revelled in the contemplation of a
time &lsquo;when the Christian religion shall have faded from the earth,
when its memory like that of Polytheism now shall remain, but
remain only as the subject of ridicule and wonder&rsquo;. But as time
went on, Shelley&rsquo;s views became less purely negative. Instead of
ruling the adversaries back to back out of court, he bethought
himself of venturing a plea in favour of the older and weaker one.
<a name="ref210">It may have been in 1817 that he contemplated an
&lsquo;Essay in favour of polytheism&rsquo;.</a><a href="#fn210" class=
"fnref">10</a> He was then living on the fringe of a charmed circle
of amateur and adventurous Hellenists who could have furthered the
scheme. His great friend, Thomas Love Peacock, &lsquo;Greeky Peaky&rsquo;, was
a personal acquaintance of Thomas Taylor &lsquo;the Platonist&rsquo;, alias
&lsquo;Pagan Taylor&rsquo;. And Taylor&rsquo;s translations and commentaries of Plato
had been favourites of Shelley in his college days. Something at
least of Taylor&rsquo;s queer mixture of flaming enthusiasm and tortuous
ingenuity may be said to appear in the unexpected document we have
now to examine.</p>

<p class="prose">It is a little draft of an Essay, which occurs, in
Mrs. Shelley&rsquo;s handwriting, as an insertion in her Journal for the
Italian period. <a name="ref211">The fragment&mdash;for it is no

<p class="prose">The only public revelation that Jehovah ever made
of himself was on Mt Sinai&mdash;Every other depended upon the testimony
of a very few &amp; usually of a single individual&mdash;We will first
therefore consider the revelation of Mount Sinai. Taking the fact
plainly it happened thus. The Jews were told by a man whom they
believed to have supernatural powers that they were to prepare for
that God w<sup>d</sup> reveal himself in three days on the mountain
at the sound of a trumpet. On the 3rd day there was a cloud &amp;
lightning on the mountain &amp; the voice of a trumpet extremely
loud. The people were ordered to stand round the foot of the
mountain &amp; not on pain of death to infringe upon the bounds&mdash;The
man in whom they confided went up the mountain &amp; came down
again bringing them word</p>

<p class="prose">The draft unfortunately leaves off here, and we
are unable to know for certain whether this Shelleyan paradox,
greatly daring, meant to minimize the importance of the &lsquo;only
public revelation&rsquo; granted to the chosen people. But we have enough
to understand the general trend of the argument. It did not
actually intend to sap the foundations of Scriptural authority. But
it was bold enough to risk a little shaking in order to prove that
the Sacred Books of the Greeks and Romans did not, after all,
present us with a much more rickety structure. This was a task of
conciliation rather than destruction. And yet even this
conservative view of the Shelleys&rsquo; exegesis cannot&mdash;and will
not&mdash;detract from the value of the above document. Surely, this curious
theory of the equal &lsquo;inspiration&rsquo; of Polytheism and the Jewish or
Christian religions, whether it was invented or simply espoused by
Mrs. Shelley, evinces in her&mdash;for the time being at least&mdash;a very
considerable share of that adventurous if somewhat uncritical
alacrity of mind which carried the poet through so many religious
and political problems. <a name="ref218">It certainly vindicates
her, more completely perhaps than anything hitherto published,
against the strictures of those who knew her chiefly or exclusively
in later years, and could speak of her as a &lsquo;most conventional
slave&rsquo;, who &lsquo;even affected the pious dodge&rsquo;, and &lsquo;was not a
suitable companion for the poet&rsquo;.</a><a href="#fn218" class=
"fnref">18</a> Mrs. Shelley&mdash;at twenty-three years of age&mdash;had not
yet run the full &lsquo;career of her humour&rsquo;; <a name="ref219">and her
enthusiasm for classical mythology may well have, later on, gone
the way of her admiration for Spinoza, whom she read with Shelley
that winter (1820-1), as Medwin notes,</a><a href="#fn219" class=
"fnref">19</a> and &lsquo;whose arguments she then thought
irrefutable&mdash;<span class="foreign">tempora mutantur!</span>&rsquo;</p>

<p class="prose">However that may be, the two little mythological
dramas on <span class="booktitle">Proserpine</span> and <span
class="booktitle">Midas</span> assume, in the light of that
enthusiasm, a special interest. They stand&mdash;or fall&mdash;both as a
literary, and to a certain extent as an intellectual effort. They
are more than an attitude, and not much less than an avowal. Not
only do they claim our attention as the single poetical work of any
length which seems to have been undertaken by Mrs. Shelley; they
are a unique and touching monument of that intimate co-operation
which at times, especially in the early years in Italy, could make
the union of &lsquo;the May&rsquo; and &lsquo;the Elf&rsquo; almost unreservedly
delightful. It would undoubtedly be fatuous exaggeration to ascribe
a very high place in literature to these little Ovidian fancies of
Mrs. Shelley. The scenes, after all, are little better than
adaptations&mdash;fairly close adaptations&mdash;of the Latin poet&rsquo;s well-known
tales.</p>

<p class="prose"><a name="ref220">Even <span class=
"booktitle">Proserpine</span>, though clearly the more successful
of the two, both more strongly knit as drama, and less uneven in
style and versification, cannot for a moment compare with the far
more original interpretations of Tennyson, Swinburne, or
Meredith.</a><a href="#fn220" class="fnref">20</a> But it is hardly
fair to draw in the great names of the latter part of the century.
The parallel would be more illuminating&mdash;and the final award passed
on Mrs. Shelley&rsquo;s attempt more favourable&mdash;if we were to think of a
contemporary production like &lsquo;Barry Cornwall&rsquo;s&rsquo; <span class=
"booktitle">Rape of Proserpine</span>, which, being published in
1820, it is just possible that the Shelleys should have known. B.
W. Procter&rsquo;s poem is also a dramatic &lsquo;scene&rsquo;, written &lsquo;in imitation
of the mode originated by the Greek Tragic Writers&rsquo;. <a name=
"ref221">In fact those hallowed models seem to have left far fewer
traces in Barry Cornwall&rsquo;s verse than the Alexandrian&mdash;or
pseudo-Alexandrian&mdash;tradition of meretricious graces and coquettish
fancies, which the eighteenth century had already run to
death.</a><a href="#fn221" class="fnref">21</a> And, more damnable
still, the poetical essence of the legend, the identification of
Proserpine&rsquo;s twofold existence with the grand alternation of
nature&rsquo;s seasons, has been entirely neglected by the author. Surely
his work, though published, is quite as deservedly obscure as Mrs.
Shelley&rsquo;s derelict manuscript. <span class="booktitle">Midas</span>
has the privilege, if it be one, of not challenging any obvious
comparison. The subject, since Lyly&rsquo;s and Dryden&rsquo;s days, has hardly
attracted the attention of the poets. <a name="ref222">It was so
eminently fit for the lighter kinds of presentation that the agile
bibliographer who aimed at completeness would have to go through a
fairly long list of masques,</a><a href="#fn222" class=
"fnref">22</a> comic operas, or &lsquo;burlettas&rsquo;, all dealing with the
ludicrous misfortunes of the Phrygian king. But an examination of
these would be sheer pedantry in this place. <a name="ref223">Here
again Mrs. Shelley has stuck to her Latin source as closely as she
could.</a><a href="#fn223" class="fnref">23</a> She has made a
gallant attempt to connect the two stories with which Midas has
ever since Ovid&rsquo;s days been associated, and a distinct&mdash;indeed a too
perceptible&mdash;effort to press out a moral meaning in this, as she had
easily extricated a cosmological meaning in the other tale.</p>

<p class="prose">Perhaps we have said too much to introduce these
two little unpretending poetical dramas. They might indeed have
been allowed to speak for themselves. A new frame often makes a new
face; and some of the best known and most exquisite of Shelley&rsquo;s
lyrics, when restored to the surroundings for which the poet
intended them, needed no other set-off to appeal to the reader with
a fresh charm of quiet classical grace and beauty. But the charm
will operate all the more unfailingly, if we remember that this
clear classical mood was by no means such a common element in the
literary atmosphere of the times&mdash;not even a permanent element in
the authors&rsquo; lives. We have here none of the feverish ecstasy that
lifts <span class="booktitle">Prometheus</span> and <span class=
"booktitle">Hellas</span> far above the ordinary range of
philosophical or political poetry. But Shelley&rsquo;s encouragement,
probably his guidance and supervision, have raised his wife&rsquo;s
inspiration to a place considerably higher than that of <span
class="booktitle">Frankenstein</span> or <span class=
"booktitle">Valperga</span>. With all their faults these pages
reflect some of that irradiation which Shelley cast around his own
life&mdash;the irradiation of a dream beauteous and generous, beauteous
in its theology (or its substitute for theology) and generous even
in its satire of human weaknesses.</p>

<p class="script"><span class="character">Eun.</span> How weary am
I! and the hot sun flushes<br>
 My cheeks that else were white with fear and grief[.]<br>
 E&rsquo;er since that fatal day, dear sister nymph,<br>
 On which we lost our lovely Proserpine,<br>
 I have but wept and watched the livelong night<br>
 And all the day have wandered through the woods[.]</p>

<p class="script"><span class="character">Ino.</span> How all is
changed since that unhappy eve!<br>
 Ceres forever weeps, seeking her child,<br>
 And in her rage has struck the land with blight;<br>
 Trinacria mourns with her;&mdash;its fertile fields<br>
 Are dry and barren, and all little brooks<br>
 Struggling scarce creep within their altered banks;<br>
 The flowers that erst were wont with bended heads,<br>
 To gaze within the clear and glassy wave,<br>
 Have died, unwatered by the failing stream.&mdash;<br>
 And yet their hue but mocks the deeper grief<br>
 Which is the fountain of these bitter tears.<br>
 But who is this, that with such eager looks</p>

 A stranger naiad, yet you know her well.</p>

<p class="stagenote">Enter Arethusa.</p>

<p class="scriptcont">Dear Arethuse,<br>
 Methinks I read glad tidings in your eyes,<br>
 Your smiles are the swift messengers that bear<br>
 A tale of coming joy, which we, alas!<br>
 Can answer but with tears, unless you bring<br>
 To our grief solace, Hope to our Despair.<br>
 Have you found Proserpine? or know you where<br>
 The loved nymph wanders, hidden from our search?</p>

<p class="script"><span class="character">Areth.</span> Where is
corn-crowned Ceres? I have hastened<br>
 To ease her anxious heart.</p>

<p class="script"><span class="character">Eun.</span> Oh! dearest
Naiad,<br>
 Herald of joy! Now will great Ceres bless<br>
 Thy welcome coming &amp; more welcome tale.</p>

<p class="script"><span class="character">Ino.</span> Since that
unhappy day when Ceres lost<br>
 Her much-loved child, she wanders through the isle;<br>
 Dark blight is showered from her looks of sorrow;&mdash;<br>
 And where tall corn and all seed-bearing grass<br>
 Rose from beneath her step, they wither now</p>

<p class="pagenum">[18]</p>

<p class="scriptcont">Fading under the frown of her bent brows:<br>
 The springs decrease;&mdash;the fields whose delicate green<br>
 Was late her chief delight, now please alone,<br>
 Because they, withered, seem to share her grief.</p>

Goddess! how I pity thee!</p>

<p class="script"><span class="character">Ino.</span> At night upon
high Etna&rsquo;s topmost peak<br>
 She lights two flames, that shining through the isle<br>
 Leave dark no wood, or cave, or mountain path,<br>
 Their sunlike splendour makes the moon-beams dim,<br>
 And the bright stars are lost within their day.<br>
 She&rsquo;s in yon field,&mdash;she comes towards this plain,<br>
 Her loosened hair has fallen on her neck,<br>
 Uncircled by the coronal of grain:&mdash;<br>
 Her cheeks are wan,&mdash;her step is faint &amp; slow.</p>

<p class="stagenote">Enter Ceres.</p>

<p class="script"><span class="character">Cer.</span> I faint with
weariness: a dreadful thirst<br>
 Possesses me! Must I give up the search?<br>
 Oh! never, dearest Proserpine, until<br>
 I once more clasp thee in my vacant arms!<br>
 Help me, dear Arethuse! fill some deep shell<br>
 With the clear waters of thine ice-cold spring,<br>
 And bring it me;&mdash;I faint with heat and thirst.</p>

<p class="script"><span class="character">Areth.</span> My words

<p class="script"><span class="character">Areth.</span> Sit,
Goddess,<br>
 Upon this mossy bank, beneath the shade<br>
 Of this tall rock, and I will tell my tale.<br>
 The day you lost your child, I left my source.<br>
 With my Alpheus I had wandered down<br>
 The sloping shore into the sunbright sea;<br>
 And at the coast we paused, watching the waves<br>
 Of our mixed waters dance into the main:&mdash;<br>
 When suddenly I heard the thundering tread<br>
 Of iron hoofed steeds trampling the ground,<br>
 And a faint shriek that made my blood run cold.<br>
 I saw the King of Hell in his black car,<br>
 And in his arms he bore your fairest child,<br>
 Fair as the moon encircled by the night,&mdash;<br>
 But that she strove, and cast her arms aloft,<br>
 And cried, &ldquo;My Mother!&rdquo;&mdash;When she saw me near<br>
 She would have sprung from his detested arms,<br>
 And with a tone of deepest grief, she cried,<br>
 &ldquo;Oh, Arethuse!&rdquo; I hastened at her call&mdash;<br>
 But Pluto when he saw that aid was nigh,<br>
 Struck furiously the green earth with his spear,</p>

<p class="pagenum">[20]</p>

<p class="scriptcont">Which yawned,&mdash;and down the deep Tartarian
gulph<br>
 His black car rolled&mdash;the green earth closed above.</p>

<p class="script"><span class="character">Cer.</span> (<em>starting
up</em>)<br>
 Is this thy doom, great Jove? &amp; shall Hell&rsquo;s king<br>
 Quitting dark Tartarus, spread grief and tears<br>
 Among the dwellers of your bright abodes?<br>
 Then let him seize the earth itself, the stars,&mdash;<br>
 And all your wide dominion be his prey!&mdash;<br>
 Your sister calls upon your love, great King!<br>
 As you are God I do demand your help!&mdash;<br>
 Restore my child, or let all heaven sink,<br>
 And the fair world be chaos once again!</p>

<p class="script"><span class="character">Ino.</span> Look[!] in
the East that loveliest bow is formed[;]<br>
 Heaven&rsquo;s single-arched bridge, it touches now<br>
 The Earth, and &rsquo;mid the pathless wastes of heaven<br>
 It paves a way for Jove&rsquo;s fair Messenger;&mdash;<br>
 Iris descends, and towards this field she comes.</p>

<p class="script"><span class="character">Areth.</span> Sovereign
of Harvests, &rsquo;tis the Messenger<br>
 That will bring joy to thee. Thine eyes light up<br>
 With sparkling hope, thy cheeks are pale with dread.</p>

<p class="stagenote">Enter Iris.</p>

<p class="script"><span class="character">Cer.</span> Speak,
heavenly Iris! let thy words be poured<br>
 Into my drooping soul, like dews of eve<br>
 On a too long parched field.&mdash;Where is my Proserpine?</p>

<p class="script"><span class="character">Iris.</span> Sister of
Heaven, as by Joves throne I stood<br>
 The voice of thy deep prayer arose,&mdash;it filled<br>
 The heavenly courts with sorrow and dismay:<br>
 The Thunderer frowned, &amp; heaven shook with dread<br>
 I bear his will to thee, &rsquo;tis fixed by fate,<br>
 Nor prayer nor murmur e&rsquo;er can alter it.<br>
 If Proserpine while she has lived in hell<br>
 Has not polluted by Tartarian food<br>
 Her heavenly essence, then she may return,<br>
 And wander without fear on Enna&rsquo;s plain,<br>
 Or take her seat among the Gods above.<br>
 If she has touched the fruits of Erebus,<br>
 She never may return to upper air,<br>
 But doomed to dwell amidst the shades of death,<br>
 The wife of Pluto and the Queen of Hell.</p>

 But when hard frost congeals the bare, black ground,<br>

 Farewel, sweet child, Queen of the nether world,<br>
 There shine as chaste Diana&rsquo;s silver car<br>
 Islanded in the deep circumfluous night.<br>
 Giver of fruits! for such thou shalt be styled,<br>
 Sweet Prophetess of Summer, coming forth<br>
 From the slant shadow of the wintry earth,<br>
 In thy car drawn by snowy-breasted swallows!<br>
 Another kiss, &amp; then again farewel!<br>
 Winter in losing thee has lost its all,<br>
 And will be doubly bare, &amp; hoar, &amp; drear,<br>
 Its bleak winds whistling o&rsquo;er the cold pinched ground<br>
 Which neither flower or grass will decorate.<br>
 And as my tears fall first, so shall the trees<br>
 Shed their changed leaves upon your six months tomb:<br>
 The clouded air will hide from Phoebus&rsquo; eye<br>
 The dreadful change your absence operates.<br>
 Thus has black Pluto changed the reign of Jove,<br>
 He seizes half the Earth when he takes thee.</p>

 And as I pass my hand thus through the air,<br>
 A little shower of sightless dust falls down<br>
 A shower of gold. O, now I am a king!<br>
 I&rsquo;ve spread my hands against my palace walls,<br>
 I&rsquo;ve set high ladders up, that I may touch<br>
 Each crevice and each cornice with my hands,<br>
 And it will all be gold:&mdash;a golden palace,<br>
 Surrounded by a wood of golden trees,<br>
 Which will bear golden fruits.&mdash;The very ground<br>
 My naked foot treads on is yellow gold,</p>

<p class="pagenum">[53]</p>

<p class="scriptcont">Invaluable gold! my dress is gold!<br>
 Now I am great! Innumerable armies<br>
 Wait till my gold collects them round my throne;<br>
 I see my standard made of woven gold.<br>
 Waving o&rsquo;er Asia&rsquo;s utmost Citadels,<br>
 Guarded by myriads invincible.<br>
 Or if the toil of war grows wearisome,<br>
 I can buy Empires:&mdash;India shall be mine,<br>
 Its blooming beauties, gold-encrusted baths,<br>
 Its aromatic groves and palaces,<br>
 All will be mine! Oh, Midas, ass-eared king!<br>
 I love thee more than any words can tell,<br>
 That thus thy touch, thou man akin to Gods,<br>
 Can change all earth to heaven,&mdash;Olympian gold!<br>
 For what makes heaven different from earth!<br>
 Look how my courtiers come! Magnificent!<br>
 None shall dare wait on me but those who bear<br>
 An empire on their backs in sheets of gold.<br>
 Oh, what a slave I was! my flocks &amp; kine,<br>
 My vineyards &amp; my corn were all my wealth<br>
 And men esteemed me rich; but now Great Jove<br>
 Transcends me but by lightning, and who knows<br>
 If my gold win not the Cyclopean Powers,<br>
 And Vulcan, who must hate his father&rsquo;s rule,</p>

<p class="pagenum">[54]</p>

<p class="scriptcont">To forge me bolts?&mdash;and then&mdash;but hush! they
come.</p>

<p class="stagenote">Enter Zopyrion, Asphalion, &amp; Lacon.</p>

<p class="script"><span class="character">Lac.</span> Pardon us,
mighty king&mdash;</p>

<p class="script"><span class="character">Mid.</span> What would
ye, slaves?<br>
 Oh! I could buy you all with one slight touch<br>
 Of my gold-making hand!</p>

<p class="script"><span class="character">Asph.</span> Royal
Midas,<br>
 We humbly would petition for relief.</p>

<p class="script"><span class="character">Mid.</span> Relief I
Bring me your copper coin, your brass,<br>
 Or what ye will&mdash;ye&rsquo;ll speedily be rich.</p>

<p class="script"><span class="character">Zopyr.</span> &rsquo;Tis not
for gold, but to be rid of gold,<br>
 That we intrude upon your Majesty.<br>
 I fear that you will suffer by this gift,<br>
 As we do now. Look at our backs bent down<br>
 With the huge weight of the great cloaks of gold.<br>
 Permit us to put on our shabby dress,<br>
 Our poor despised garments of light wool:&mdash;<br>
 We walk as porters underneath a load.<br>
 Pity, great king, our human weaknesses,<br>
 Nor force us to expire&mdash;</p>

<p class="script"><span class="character">Mid.</span> Begone, ye
slaves!<br>
 Go clothe your wretched limbs in ragged skins!<br>
 Take an old carpet to wrap round your legs,</p>

<p class="pagenum">[55]</p>

<p class="scriptcont">A broad leaf for your feet&mdash;ye shall not
wear<br>
 That dress&mdash;those golden sandals&mdash;monarch like.</p>

<p class="script"><span class="character">Asph.</span> If you would
have us walk a mile a day<br>
 We cannot thus&mdash;already we are tired<br>
 With the huge weight of soles of solid gold.</p>

<p class="script"><span class="character">Mid.</span> Pitiful
wretches! Earth-born, groveling dolts!<br>
 Begone! nor dare reply to my just wrath!<br>
 Never behold me more! or if you stay<br>
 Let not a sigh, a shrug, a stoop betray<br>
 What poor, weak, miserable men you are.<br>
 Not as I&mdash;I am a God! Look, dunce!<br>
 I tread or leap beneath this load of gold!</p>

<p class="stagedir">(Jumps &amp; stops suddenly.)</p>

<p class="scriptcont">I&rsquo;ve hurt my back:&mdash;this cloak is wondrous
hard!<br>
 No more of this! my appetite would say<br>
 The hour is come for my noon-day repast.</p>

<p class="script"><span class="character">Lac.</span> It comes
borne in by twenty lusty slaves,<br>
 Who scarce can lift the mass of solid gold,<br>
 That lately was a table of light wood.<br>
 Here is the heavy golden ewer &amp; bowl,<br>
 In which, before you eat, you wash your hands.</p>

<p class="script"><span class="character">Mid.</span> (<em>lifting

 This is to be a king! to touch pure gold!</p>

<p class="scriptcont">Would that by touching thee, Zopyrion,<br>
 I could transmute thee to a golden man;<br>
 A crowd of golden slaves to wait on me!</p>

<p class="stagedir">(Pours the water on his hands.)</p>

<p class="scriptcont">But how is this? the water that I touch<br>
 Falls down a stream of yellow liquid gold,<br>
 And hardens as it falls. I cannot wash&mdash;<br>
 Pray Bacchus, I may drink! and the soft towel<br>
 With which I&rsquo;d wipe my hands transmutes itself<br>
 Into a sheet of heavy gold.&mdash;No more!<br>
 I&rsquo;ll sit and eat:&mdash;I have not tasted food<br>
 For many hours, I have been so wrapt<br>
 In golden dreams of all that I possess,<br>
 I had not time to eat; now hunger calls<br>
 And makes me feel, though not remote in power<br>
 From the immortal Gods, that I need food,<br>
 The only remnant of mortality!</p>

<p class="stagedir">(In vain attempts to eat of several
dishes.)</p>

<p class="scriptcont">Alas! my fate! &rsquo;tis gold! this peach is
gold!<br>
 This bread, these grapes &amp; all I touch! this meat<br>
 Which by its scent quickened my appetite<br>
 Has lost its scent, its taste,&mdash;&rsquo;tis useless gold.</p>

put that apple to my mouth;<br>
 If my hands touch it not perhaps I eat.<br>
 Alas! I cannot bite! as it approached<br>
 I felt its fragrance, thought it would be mine,<br>
 But by the touch of my life-killing lips<br>
 &rsquo;Tis changed from a sweet fruit to tasteless gold,<br>
 Bacchus will not refresh me by his gifts,<br>
 The liquid wine congeals and flies my taste.<br>
 Go, miserable slaves! Oh, wretched king!<br>
 Away with food! Its sight now makes me sick.<br>
 Bring in my couch! I will sleep off my care,<br>
 And when I wake I&rsquo;ll coin some remedy.<br>
 I dare not bathe this sultry day, for fear<br>
 I be enclosed in gold. Begone!<br>
 I will to rest:&mdash;oh, miserable king!</p>

<p class="stagedir">(Exeunt all but Midas. He lies down, turns
restlessly for some time &amp; then rises.)</p>

<p class="scriptcont">Oh! fool! to wish to change all things to
gold!<br>
 Blind Ideot that I was! This bed is gold;<br>
 And this hard, weighty pillow, late so soft,<br>
 That of itself invited me to rest,<br>
 Is a hard lump, that if I sleep and turn</p>

<p class="pagenum">[58]</p>

<p class="scriptcont">I may beat out my brains against its
sides.<br>
 Oh! what a wretched thing I am! how blind!<br>
 I cannot eat, for all my food is gold;<br>
 Drink flies my parched lips, and my hard couch<br>
 Is worse than rock to my poor bruised sides.<br>
 I cannot walk; the weight of my gold soles<br>
 Pulls me to earth:&mdash;my back is broke beneath<br>
 These gorgeous garments&mdash; (<em>throws off his cloak</em>)<br>
 Lie there, golden cloak!<br>
 There on thy kindred earth, lie there and rot!<br>
 I dare not touch my forehead with my palm<br>
 For fear my very flesh should turn to gold.<br>
 Oh! let me curse thee, vilest, yellow dirt!<br>
 Here, on my knees, thy martyr lifts his voice,<br>
 A poor, starved wretch who can touch nought but thee[,]<br>
 Wilt thou refresh me in the heat of noon?<br>
 Canst thou be kindled for me when I&rsquo;m cold?<br>
 May all men, &amp; the immortal Gods,<br>
 Hate &amp; spurn thee as wretched I do now.</p>

<p class="stagedir">(Kicks the couch, &amp; tries to throw down the

weight</p>

 Bacchus, O pity, pardon, and restore me!<br>
 Who waits?</p>

<p class="scriptcont">Go bid the priests that they prepare<br>
 Most solemn song and richest sacrifise;&mdash;<br>
 Which I may not dare touch, lest it should turn<br>
 To most unholy gold.</p>

<p class="script"><span class="character">Lacon.</span> Pardon me,
oh King,<br>
 But perhaps the God may give that you may eat,<br>
 And yet your touch be magic.</p>

<p class="script"><span class="character">Mid.</span> No more, thou
slave!<br>
 Gold is my fear, my bane, my death! I hate<br>
 Its yellow glare, its aspect hard and cold.<br>
 I would be rid of all.&mdash;Go bid them haste.</p>

<p class="stagedir">(Exit Lacon.)</p>

<p class="scriptcont">Oh, Bacchus I be propitious to their
prayer!<br>
 Make me a hind, clothe me in ragged skins&mdash;<br>
 And let my food be bread, unsavoury roots,<br>
 But take from me the frightful curse of gold.<br>
 Am I not poor? Alas! how I am changed!<br>
 Poorer than meanest slaves, my piles of wealth<br>
 Cannot buy for me one poor, wretched dish:&mdash;<br>
 In summer heat I cannot bathe, nor wear<br>
 A linen dress; the heavy, dull, hard metal<br>
 Clings to me till I pray for poverty.</p>

<p class="pagenum">[60]</p>

<p class="stagenote">Enter Zopyrion, Asphalion &amp; Lacon.</p>

<p class="script"><span class="character">Zopyr.</span> The
sacrifice is made, &amp; the great God,<br>
 Pitying your ills, oh King, accepted it,<br>
 Whilst his great oracle gave forth these words.<br>
 &ldquo;Let poor king Midas bathe in the clear stream<br>

 &ldquo;The gold-transmuting power, which he repents.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="script"><span class="character">Mid.</span> Oh joy! Oh
Bacchus, thanks for this to thee<br>
 Will I each year offer three sucking lambs&mdash;<br>
 Games will I institute&mdash;nor Pan himself<br>
 Shall have more honour than thy deity.<br>
 Haste to the stream,&mdash;I long to feel the cool<br>
 And liquid touch of its divinest waves.</p>

<p class="stagedir">(Exeunt all except Zopyrion and Asphalion.)</p>

<p class="script"><span class="character">Asph.</span> Off with our
golden sandals and our cloaks!<br>
 Oh, I shall ever hate the sight of gold!<br>
 Poor, wealthy Midas runs as if from death<br>
 To rid him quick of this meta[l]lic curse.</p>

<p class="script"><span class="character">Zopyr.</span>
(<em>aside</em>) I wonder if his asses[&rsquo;] ears are gold;<br>
 What would I give to let the secret out?<br>
 Gold! that is trash, we have too much of it,&mdash;<br>
 But I would give ten new born lambs to tell<br>
 This most portentous truth&mdash;but I must choke.</p>

<p class="script"><span class="character">Asph.</span> Now we shall
tend our flocks and reap our corn<br>
 As we were wont, and not be killed by gold.</p>

<p class="pagenum">[61]</p>

<p class="scriptcont">Golden fleeces threatened our poor sheep,<br>
 The very showers as they fell from heaven<br>
 Could not refresh the earth; the wind blew gold,<br>
 And <a name="ref601">as we walked</a><a href="#fn601" class=

 Wounded our faces&mdash;the navies would have sunk&mdash;</p>

<p class="script"><span class="character">Zopyr.</span> All
strangers would have fled our gold-cursed shore,<br>
 Till we had bound our wealthy king, that he<br>
 Might leave the green and fertile earth unchanged;&mdash;<br>
 Then in deep misery he would have shook<br>
 His golden chains &amp; starved.</p>

<p class="stagenote">Enter Lacon.</p>

<p class="script"><span class="character">Lacon.</span> Sluggards,
how now I<br>
 Have you not been to gaze upon the sight?<br>
 To see the noble king cast off the gift<br>
 Which he erewhile so earnestly did crave[?]</p>

<p class="script"><span class="character">Asph.</span> I am so
tired with the weight of gold<br>
 I bore to-day I could not budge a foot<br>
 To see the finest sight Jove could display.<br>
 But tell us, Lacon, what he did and said.</p>

<p class="script"><span class="character">Lac.</span> Although he&rsquo;d
fain have run[,] his golden dress<br>
 And heavy sandals made the poor king limp<br>
 As leaning upon mine and the high priest&rsquo;s arm,<br>
 He hastened to Pactolus. When he saw<br>
 The stream&mdash;&ldquo;Thanks to the Gods!&rdquo; he cried aloud<br>
 In joy; then having cast aside his robes<br>
 He leaped into the waves, and with his palm</p>

<p class="pagenum">[62]</p>

<p class="scriptcont">Throwing the waters high&mdash;&ldquo;This is not
gold,&rdquo;<br>
 He cried, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m free, I have got rid of gold.&rdquo;<br>
 And then he drank, and seizing with delight<br>
 A little leaf that floated down the stream,<br>
 &ldquo;Thou art not gold,&rdquo; he said&mdash;</p>

<p class="script"><span class="character">Zopyr.</span> But all
this time&mdash;<br>
 Did you behold?&mdash;Did he take off his crown?&mdash;</p>

<p class="script"><span class="character">Lacon.</span> No:&mdash;It was
strange to see him as he plunged<br>
 Hold tight his crown with his left hand the while.</p>

<p class="script"><span class="character">Zopyr.</span>
(<em>aside</em>) Alas, my fate! I thought they had been seen.</p>

<p class="script"><span class="character">Lac.</span> He ordered
garments to the river side<br>
 Of coarsest texture;&mdash;those that erst he wore<br>
 He would not touch, for they were trimmed with gold.</p>

<p class="script"><span class="character">Zopyr.</span> And yet he
did not throw away his crown?</p>

<p class="script"><span class="character">Lac.</span> He ever held
it tight as if he thought<br>
 Some charm attached to its remaining there.<br>
 Perhaps he is right;&mdash;know you, Zopyrion,<br>
 If that strange voice this morning spoke the truth?</p>

<p class="script"><span class="character">Zopyr.</span> Nay
guess;&mdash;think of what passed &amp; you can judge.<br>
 I dare not&mdash;I know nothing of his ears.</p>

<p class="script"><span class="character">Lac.</span> I am resolved
some night when he sleeps sound<br>
 To get a peep.&mdash;No more,&rsquo;tis he that comes.<br>
 He has now lost the boon that Bacchus gave,<br>
 Having bestowed it on the limpid waves.</p>

<p class="pagenum">[63]</p>

<p class="scriptcont">Now over golden sands Pactolus runs,<br>
 And as it flows creates a mine of wealth.</p>

<p class="stagenote">Enter Midas, (with grapes in his hand).</p>

<p class="script"><span class="character">Mid.</span> I see again
the trees and smell the flowers<br>
 With colours lovelier than the rainbow&rsquo;s self;<br>
 I see the gifts of rich-haired Ceres piled<br>
 And eat. (<em>holding up the grapes</em>)<br>
 This is not yellow, dirty gold,<br>
 But blooms with precious tints, purple and green.<br>
 I hate this palace and its golden floor,<br>
 Its cornices and rafters all of gold:&mdash;<br>
 I&rsquo;ll build a little bower of freshest green,<br>
 Canopied o&rsquo;er with leaves &amp; floored with moss:&mdash;<br>
 I&rsquo;ll dress in skins;&mdash;I&rsquo;ll drink from wooden cups<br>
 And eat on wooden platters&mdash;sleep on flock;<br>
 None but poor men shall dare attend on me.<br>
 All that is gold I&rsquo;ll banish from my court,<br>
 Gilding shall be high treason to my state,<br>
 The very name of gold shall be crime capital[.]</p>

<p class="script"><span class="character">Zopyr.</span> May we not
keep our coin?</p>

<p class="script"><span class="character">Mid.</span> No,
Zopyrion,<br>
 None but the meanest peasants shall have gold.<br>
 It is a sordid, base and dirty thing:&mdash;<br>
 Look at the grass, the sky, the trees, the flowers,</p>

<p class="pagenum">[64]</p>

<p class="scriptcont">These are Joves treasures &amp; they are not
gold:&mdash;<br>
 Now they are mine, I am no longer cursed.&mdash;<br>
 The hapless river hates its golden sands,<br>
 As it rolls over them, having my gift;&mdash;<br>
 Poor harmless shores! they now are dirty gold.<br>
 How I detest it! Do not the Gods hate gold?<br>
 Nature displays the treasures that she loves,<br>
 She hides gold deep in the earth &amp; piles above<br>
 Mountains &amp; rocks to keep the monster down.</p>

<p class="script"><span class="character">Asph.</span> They say
Apollo&rsquo;s sunny car is gold.</p>

<p class="script"><span class="character">Mid.</span> Aye, so it is
for Gold belongs to him:&mdash;<br>
 But Phoebus is my bitterest enemy,<br>
 And what pertains to him he makes my bane.</p>

<p class="script"><span class="character">Zopyr.</span> What [!]
will your Majesty tell the world?&mdash;</p>

<p class="script"><span class="character">Mid.</span> Peace, vile
gossip! Asphalion, come you here.<br>
 Look at those golden columns; those inlaid walls;<br>
 The ground, the trees, the flowers &amp; precious food<br>
 That in my madness I did turn to gold:&mdash;<br>
 Pull it all down, I hate its sight and touch;<br>
 Heap up my cars &amp; waggons with the load<br>
 And yoke my kine to drag it to the sea:<br>
 Then crowned with flowers, ivy &amp; Bacchic vine,<br>
 And singing hymns to the immortal Gods,</p>

<p class="pagenum">[65]</p>

<p class="scriptcont">We will ascend ships freighted with the
gold,<br>
 And where no plummet&rsquo;s line can sound the depth<br>
 Of greedy Ocean, we will throw it in,<br>
 All, all this frightful heap of yellow dirt.<br>
 Down through the dark, blue waters it will sink,<br>
 Frightening the green-haired Nereids from their sport<br>
 And the strange Tritons&mdash;the waves will close above<br>
 And I, thank Bacchus, ne&rsquo;er shall see it more!<br>
 And we will make all echoing heaven ring<br>
 With our loud hymns of thanks, &amp; joyous pour<br>
 Libations in the deep, and reach the land,<br>
 Rich, happy, free &amp; great, that we have lost<br>
 Man&rsquo;s curse, heart-bartering, soul-enchaining gold.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
